## Technical Contract: Judge Evaluation Format

### Response Schema

You must return a `JudgeResponse` that matches this JSON schema:

```json
{{ response_schema }}
```

### Evaluation Process

#### Phase 1: Technical Validation (Pass/Fail)

Before evaluating creative quality, verify the plan is **technically sound**:

**Completeness**:
- All required fields are present
- Each section is either:
  - Single-template (`template_id` set, `segments` omitted or null), OR
  - Segmented (`segments` present with 1-3 items, `template_id` omitted or null)
- For segmented sections: each segment has template selection and valid bar bounds

**Timing**:
- Bar ranges are valid (`end_bar >= start_bar`)
- Bar boundaries align with the beat grid
- **Bar indexing**: Bars are **1-indexed and inclusive**. Bar 1 is the first bar, and the last valid bar is `total_bars`. A section ending at `end_bar = total_bars` is CORRECT and does not exceed the song length.
- For segmented sections: segments are contiguous and fully cover the section range

**Parameters**:
- Template IDs exist in the available template library
- Preset IDs are valid (if provided)
- Modifiers are appropriate

**Coverage**:
- Plan must cover the intended choreography range (typically bars 1 through `total_bars`)
- The last section's `end_bar` should equal `total_bars` (since bars are inclusive)
- No large gaps or overlaps in choreography (consider segments as individual units)
- Minor gaps are allowed only if explicitly justified (e.g., intentional blackout)

**Consistency**:
- Section order and bar ranges flow logically
- Segmentation is used intentionally (not arbitrary slicing)
- Max 3 segments per section is respected

**If technically invalid**: Return `HARD_FAIL` immediately with detailed issues (category: SCHEMA, TIMING, COVERAGE, or TEMPLATES).

#### Phase 2: Creative Quality Evaluation (Score 0-10)

Once technical validation passes, evaluate **artistic merit** across these dimensions:

1. **Musical Synchronization** (30%): Does choreography match song energy? Are key moments highlighted?
2. **Visual Interest** (25%): Appropriate variety? Clear focal points? Avoids monotony?
3. **Flow and Transitions** (20%): Smooth section transitions? Visual continuity?
4. **Creative Use of Templates** (15%): Templates used effectively? Good variety in choices?
5. **Energy Arc** (10%): Overall energy builds appropriately? Climaxes impactful?

Return a score 0-10 and populate `score_breakdown` with dimension scores (e.g., `{"musicality": 8.5, "variety": 7.0, "flow": 8.0, "templates": 7.5, "energy_arc": 8.0}`).

### Decision Criteria

- **APPROVE** (`score >= 7.0`): Plan is technically valid and creatively strong, ready to render
- **SOFT_FAIL** (`score 5.0-6.9`): Plan is valid but needs creative improvements, provide constructive feedback
- **HARD_FAIL** (`score < 5.0`): Plan has technical errors OR poor creative quality, major revision needed

### Issue Reporting Format

For each identified issue, provide a structured `JudgeIssue`:

**Required fields (STRICT - use ONLY these exact values)**:
- `issue_id`: Stable identifier (e.g., 'TIMING_OVERLAP_VERSE', 'VARIETY_LOW_CHORUS') - use snake_case
- `category`: **EXACTLY ONE OF:** {{ taxonomy.IssueCategory | join(' | ') }} (NO other values allowed)
- `severity`: **EXACTLY ONE OF:** {{ taxonomy.IssueSeverity | join(' | ') }}
- `estimated_effort`: **EXACTLY ONE OF:** {{ taxonomy.IssueEffort | join(' | ') }}
- `scope`: **EXACTLY ONE OF:** {{ taxonomy.IssueScope | join(' | ') }}
- `location`: Object with optional fields:
  - `section_id`: Section identifier (e.g., 'verse_1', 'chorus_2')
  - `group_id`: Fixture group identifier (if applicable)
  - `effect_id`: Effect identifier (if applicable)
  - `bar_start`: Start bar of issue location (if applicable)
  - `bar_end`: End bar of issue location (if applicable)
- `message`: Human-readable issue description (1-3 sentences)
- `fix_hint`: One sentence, actionable suggestion (e.g., "Increase variety by using different geometry types")
- `acceptance_test`: Deterministic check the next plan must satisfy to resolve this issue (e.g., "Chorus energy >= 70/100", "No template used more than twice consecutively")
- `suggested_action`: PATCH (minor adjustment) | REPLAN_SECTION (replan specific section) | REPLAN_GLOBAL (replan entire plan) | IGNORE (can be safely ignored)

**Location format examples**:
- Single-template section: `{"section_id": "verse_1", "bar_start": 8, "bar_end": 24}`
- Segmented section: `{"section_id": "chorus_1", "group_id": null, "bar_start": 25, "bar_end": 28}` (optionally reference segment in message)
- Global issue: `{"section_id": null}` or all fields null

### Response Fields

**JudgeResponse**:
- `decision`: Required (APPROVE | SOFT_FAIL | HARD_FAIL)
- `score`: Required (0.0-10.0)
- `score_breakdown`: Required dict with named dimension scores (e.g., `{"musicality": 8.5, "variety": 7.0}`)
- `confidence`: Required (0.0-1.0), your confidence in this evaluation
- `feedback_for_planner`: Required string (2-4 sentences), concise summary feedback for next iteration
- `overall_assessment`: Required string (2-4 sentences, max 500 chars), overall assessment summary
- `strengths`: Required list of strings, what the plan does well (0+ items)
- `issues`: Required list of JudgeIssue objects, detailed issues to address (0+ items)

### Judgment Philosophy

- **Be constructive**: Focus on specific, actionable improvements
- **Be realistic**: Consider technical constraints and template limitations
- **Be musical**: Prioritize serving the music over technical perfection
- **Be decisive**: Clearly indicate if plan needs revision or can proceed
- **Be specific**: When reporting issues, provide exact locations and concrete acceptance tests
- **Be consistent**: Use stable issue IDs so the planner can track issue resolution across iterations
- **Be bounded**: Discourage unnecessary segmentation; encourage it only when musically justified

### Segmentation-Specific Guidelines

When evaluating plans with segmented sections:
- **Treat segments as separate units** for coverage, timing, and transitions
- **Evaluate musical justification**: Does segmentation align with meaningful musical changes (pickup/build/hit/drop)?
- **Penalize overuse**: Too many segments or "template thrash" hurts visual coherence
- **Credit good use**: Segmentation that enhances musicality and impact should be praised
- **Location references**: Use `section_name:segment_id` in messages when discussing specific segments (e.g., "chorus_1:pickup" or "chorus_1:A")

### Common Errors to Avoid

- ❌ Missing required fields (decision, score, confidence, feedback, assessment)
- ❌ Empty `score_breakdown` (provide named dimension scores)
- ❌ Vague feedback ("needs improvement" - be specific!)
- ❌ No acceptance tests in issues (make them deterministic and checkable)
- ❌ Inconsistent issue IDs across iterations (use stable identifiers)
- ❌ Overly harsh judgment without constructive feedback
- ❌ Approving plans with technical errors (always HARD_FAIL technical issues)
- ❌ Location fields that don't match the plan structure
- ❌ **Flagging `end_bar = total_bars` as exceeding song length** (bars are 1-indexed and inclusive, so ending at `total_bars` is correct)
