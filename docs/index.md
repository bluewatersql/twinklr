# Twinklr Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Twinklr** — an AI-powered choreography engine that transforms music into coordinated Christmas light shows using audio analysis, template composition, and multi-agent LLM orchestration.

---

## Blog Series

In-depth technical write-ups covering the design, architecture, and lessons from building Twinklr.

### [Building an AI Choreographer for Christmas Light Shows](mh_intro/index.md)

An 8-part series following the full pipeline — from raw audio through LLM planning to DMX output. Covers the architecture decisions, failure modes, and design pivots that shaped the system.
