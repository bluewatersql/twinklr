Template Compatibility: Complementary by movement type + plane separation: verse_sweep_pulse provides smooth positional sweep (tilt/overall sweep feel) while ping_pong_chase is dimmer-only motion on static positions; this is \"static hold + dynamic movement\" and avoids competing large sweeps. Channel Choices: Shutter=pulse (not strobe) because energy is moderate and we want beat reinforcement without spending strobe budget early (pulse budget 10–20% overall); Color stays blue for continuity across multiple sections (color restraint: hold 2–4 sections); Gobo=open to keep readability since we already added a second template layer. Flow: Continues from the intro’s gentle sweep into a more defined verse pulse; end pose moves toward AUDIENCE_CENTER to set up a transition/build that can tighten focus.

Template Compatibility: Complementary via scale contrast + movement type: tension_mirror_build provides larger accelerating pendulum/sweep arcs, while locked_with_tremble adds high-frequency micro-motion while staying position-locked; this is \"large sweeping + small detail\" and avoids two big sweeps fighting. Channel Choices: Shutter=pulse (not strobe) because we’re building energy but saving strobe for the actual drop/chorus peaks (shutter rules + strobe restraint); Color stays white to maintain the build’s “tension/neutral” feel and avoid too many color scenes; Gobo=clouds is added because movement is not at maximum speed and the build benefits from atmosphere/texture (gobo allowed when movement is slower/moderate). This also keeps gobo usage limited (we’ll keep gobos off for many other sections). Flow: Comes out of the smooth transition already in white and intensifies motion/tension without a jarring pose jump; ends centered to set up a focused impact template next. Confidence: 4/5 — strong complementary layering; the only caution is adding a gobo during a build, but it’s a moderate-density breakup (clouds) and movement isn’t “fast+complex gobo,” so compatibility is maintained.",

Template Compatibility: N/A — explosive_drop_strobe already contains a hit phase and sustain phase; adding more would risk sensory overload. Channel Choices: Shutter=strobe_medium to honor the drop intensity while managing fatigue (strobe only at peaks; medium rather than fast to reduce overload). Strobe budget check: this section is 8 bars; cumulative strobe so far becomes 8/164 = 4.9%, well under 30%. Color changes to red to mark the major transition into the first peak (allowed at major transition; warm color increases perceived intensity). Gobo=open because the movement is intense and strobing is already complex—per integration rule, keep other channels simple when one is intense (avoid fast movement + complex gobo). Flow: The build ended centered and tense; this snaps into a focused explosive look, then ends FORWARD to open the stage for a longer chorus sustain pattern next.

Layering Decision: Two templates because high-energy chorus sections benefit from main movement + accent, and we can create spatial dialogue/texture without resorting to triple-layer complexity (2-template layering for 0.5–0.8+; allowed here because it’s chorus sustain, not a single drop hit). Template Compatibility: Complementary by rhythm offset + movement type: energetic_fan_pulse provides continuous circular/pulsing motion, while sequential_tilt_drop adds occasional left-to-right cascading vertical hits that read as fills on top of the main bed. This is “continuous + punctuated sequential,” avoiding redundancy. Channel Choices: Shutter=open (not strobe) to prevent strobe fatigue after the drop and to keep the chorus readable despite layered movement (rule: avoid strobe→strobe transitions; also keep ONE intense element at a time). Color remains red to hold the same scene across multiple peak sections (color restraint: don’t change every section). Gobo=open because movement is energetic; adding dense gobos would overload. Flow: Smoothly continues from the drop’s red palette but relaxes shutter intensity from strobe to open, giving the audience’s eyes a break while keeping motion energy high; ends centered to set up a potential breakdown/glitch contrast.

Template Compatibility: Complementary via rhythm offset and movement type: digital_glitch is rapid irregular snap/stutter, while random_bounce is more organic physics-like motion; the contrast between “digital” and “organic” prevents redundancy and creates a layered texture that doesn’t compete in identical timing. Channel Choices: Shutter=pulse to give rhythmic definition without escalating to strobe (energy 0.5–0.7 rule; at 75 it’s slightly above, but within ±0.3 tolerance reasoning: we’re deliberately keeping shutter moderate to preserve strobe budget for the next peak). Color changes to purple to mark a major structural contrast (chorus → breakdown), and to shift mood cooler/edgier without introducing a totally new rainbow scene. Gobo=dots to add a “digital pixel” texture, but we keep shutter at pulse (not strobe) so we don’t stack too many intense elements; dots density is moderate-high but acceptable because the movement is not a sustained fast sweep—it's snap-based where the texture reads. Flow: This deliberately pivots away from the red chorus into a cooler breakdown scene; ending at SOFT_HOME prepares a clean re-build. Confidence: 3/5 — the concept is strong, but it’s a busier visual section (snap texture + gobo).
