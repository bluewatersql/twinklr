Template Compatibility: N/A (single template) — the point here is clarity and calm.

Flow: Starts at SOFT_HOME and gently moves toward FORWARD, giving a smooth on-ramp for the next medium-energy verse without a pose jump; keeping the same cool color also avoids early visual churn.

Template Compatibility: Complementary by movement type + plane separation: verse_sweep_pulse provides smooth positional sweep (tilt/overall sweep feel) while ping_pong_chase is dimmer-only motion on static positions; this is \"static hold + dynamic movement\" and avoids competing large sweeps. Channel Choices: Shutter=pulse (not strobe) because energy is moderate and we want beat reinforcement without spending strobe budget early (pulse budget 10–20% overall); Color stays blue for continuity across multiple sections (color restraint: hold 2–4 sections); Gobo=open to keep readability since we already added a second template layer. Flow: Continues from the intro’s gentle sweep into a more defined verse pulse; end pose moves toward AUDIENCE_CENTER to set up a transition/build that can tighten focus.

Template Compatibility: Complementary via scale contrast + movement type: tension_mirror_build provides larger accelerating pendulum/sweep arcs, while locked_with_tremble adds high-frequency micro-motion while staying position-locked; this is \"large sweeping + small detail\" and avoids two big sweeps fighting. Channel Choices: Shutter=pulse (not strobe) because we’re building energy but saving strobe for the actual drop/chorus peaks (shutter rules + strobe restraint); Color stays white to maintain the build’s “tension/neutral” feel and avoid too many color scenes; Gobo=clouds is added because movement is not at maximum speed and the build benefits from atmosphere/texture (gobo allowed when movement is slower/moderate). This also keeps gobo usage limited (we’ll keep gobos off for many other sections). Flow: Comes out of the smooth transition already in white and intensifies motion/tension without a jarring pose jump; ends centered to set up a focused impact template next. Confidence: 4/5 — strong complementary layering; the only caution is adding a gobo during a build, but it’s a moderate-density breakup (clouds) and movement isn’t “fast+complex gobo,” so compatibility is maintained.",

Template Compatibility: N/A — explosive_drop_strobe already contains a hit phase and sustain phase; adding more would risk sensory overload.

Strobe budget check: this section is 8 bars; cumulative strobe so far becomes 8/164 = 4.9%, well under 30%. Color changes to red to mark the major transition into the first peak (allowed at major transition; warm color increases perceived intensity). Gobo=open because the movement is intense and strobing is already complex—per integration rule, keep other channels simple when one is intense (avoid fast movement + complex gobo). Flow: The build ended centered and tense; this snaps into a focused explosive look, then ends FORWARD to open the stage for a longer chorus sustain pattern next.

Template Compatibility: Complementary by rhythm offset + movement type: energetic_fan_pulse provides continuous circular/pulsing motion, while sequential_tilt_drop adds occasional left-to-right cascading vertical hits that read as fills on top of the main bed. This is “continuous + punctuated sequential,” avoiding redundancy. Channel Choices: Shutter=open (not strobe) to prevent strobe fatigue after the drop and to keep the chorus readable despite layered movement (rule: avoid strobe→strobe transitions; also keep ONE intense element at a time). Color remains red to hold the same scene across multiple peak sections (color restraint: don’t change every section). Gobo=open because movement is energetic; adding dense gobos would overload. Flow: Smoothly continues from the drop’s red palette but relaxes shutter intensity from strobe to open, giving the audience’s eyes a break while keeping motion energy high; ends centered to set up a potential breakdown/glitch contrast.

Template Compatibility: Complementary via rhythm offset and movement type: digital_glitch is rapid irregular snap/stutter, while random_bounce is more organic physics-like motion; the contrast between “digital” and “organic” prevents redundancy and creates a layered texture that doesn’t compete in identical timing. Channel Choices: Shutter=pulse to give rhythmic definition without escalating to strobe (energy 0.5–0.7 rule; at 75 it’s slightly above, but within ±0.3 tolerance reasoning: we’re deliberately keeping shutter moderate to preserve strobe budget for the next peak). Color changes to purple to mark a major structural contrast (chorus → breakdown), and to shift mood cooler/edgier without introducing a totally new rainbow scene. Gobo=dots to add a “digital pixel” texture, but we keep shutter at pulse (not strobe) so we don’t stack too many intense elements; dots density is moderate-high but acceptable because the movement is not a sustained fast sweep—it's snap-based where the texture reads. Flow: This deliberately pivots away from the red chorus into a cooler breakdown scene; ending at SOFT_HOME prepares a clean re-build. Confidence: 3/5 — the concept is strong, but it’s a busier visual section (snap texture + gobo).

Peak moments are intentionally isolated as single-template signatures with strobe reserved for only the true drops/chorus climax, keeping total strobe well under the 30% fatigue threshold. Gobos are treated as rare texture accents (clouds in build, dots in breakdown) and otherwise kept open to preserve beam readability, especially during fast/high-energy movement.

        "reasoning": "Layering depth is strong (6/10 sections layered = 60%), and targeting uses a healthy variety of semantic groups (ALL, LEFT, RIGHT, ODD, EVEN). Channels are coordinated with LEFT/RIGHT dialogues in verse/chorus and ODD/EVEN for breakdown, demonstrating spatial thinking and temporal layering without flattening to ALL.",

    "summary": "Overall the plan and implementation demonstrate a mature, restrained design philosophy: bar-aligned sections, a clear 4-color narrative (BLUE → WHITE → RED → PURPLE → BLUE), and intentional strobe and gobo usage reserved for climactic moments ('drop_hit_1_signature_impact' bars 57-64 and 'chorus_2_peak_strobe_moment' bars 113-128). Layering is deliberately used in 6/10 sections (60%) with LEFT/RIGHT and ODD/EVEN targeting avoiding any fixture conflicts; timing coverage is complete and implementation is beat-aligned.\n\nPrimary areas to tighten are micro-level layering compatibility and texture assignment. Specifically, 'breakdown_1_glitch_contrast' (bars 81-96) layers two aggressive motion templates (digital_glitch + random_bounce) that can compete visually; consider converting one layer to a subtle texture or slower rhythmic pulse. Also verify gobo scale on fast sweep builds so patterns read cleanly (see 'crescendo_sweep_build' bars 97-112). Overall, this is a high-quality plan and implementation that passes the 70 threshold comfortably.",
    "actionable_feedback": [
      "Breakdown layering fix: For 'breakdown_1_glitch_contrast' (bars 81-96), change one layer to a slower texture or tonal layer — e.g., replace random_bounce with a muted 'low_pulse_dimmer' or 'soft_spot_hold' to create contrast with digital_glitch.",
      "Tremble restraint in build_1: In 'build_1_tension_ramp' (bars 41-56) lower locked_with_tremble amplitude or change it to 'locked_subtle_tremble' so tension_mirror_build remains the dominant structural element.",
      "Gobo usage tuning: Move one gobo texture from build_2 ('crescendo_sweep_build' bars 97-112) to a later sub-section or reduce gobo scale when paired with fast sweeps. If gobo must be present on sweep, use large-scale breakup or very soft edge gobos to maintain beam legibility.",
      "Color hold guidance: Ensure 'transition_1_palette_cleanse' (bars 33-40) remains in WHITE and flows into 'build_1' WHITE to avoid an unnecessary color flicker; reserve RED for 'drop_hit_1' and 'chorus_1' to keep the RED scene impactful.",
      "ALL usage strategy: Consider changing one of the ALL signature bars to LEFT+RIGHT with a synchronized quick ALL flash at the downbeat to allow layered accents directly before/after the main ALL hit. For example, make 'drop_hit_1' use a 1-bar ALL impact at the downbeat and surrounding 1–2 bars use LEFT/RIGHT accents so secondary layers can sit adjacent without conflict.",
      "Micro-timing: Though implementation is bar_aligned, audition ±1-2 sub-beat offsets for percussion-heavy hits (e.g., the initial hit of 'drop_hit_1') to tighten perceived synchronization with percussive transients."
