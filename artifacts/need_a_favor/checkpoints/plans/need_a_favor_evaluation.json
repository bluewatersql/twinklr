Layering is deliberately used in 6/10 sections (60%) with LEFT/RIGHT and ODD/EVEN targeting avoiding any fixture conflicts; timing coverage is complete and implementation is beat-aligned.\n\nPrimary areas to tighten are micro-level layering compatibility and texture assignment. Specifically, 'breakdown_1_glitch_contrast' (bars 81-96) layers two aggressive motion templates (digital_glitch + random_bounce) that can compete visually; consider converting one layer to a subtle texture or slower rhythmic pulse. Also verify gobo scale on fast sweep builds so patterns read cleanly (see 'crescendo_sweep_build' bars 97-112). Overall, this is a high-quality plan and implementation that passes the 70 threshold comfortably.",

    "Tremble restraint in build_1: In 'build_1_tension_ramp' (bars 41-56) lower locked_with_tremble amplitude or change it to 'locked_subtle_tremble' so tension_mirror_build remains the dominant structural element.",
    "Gobo usage tuning: Move one gobo texture from build_2 ('crescendo_sweep_build' bars 97-112) to a later sub-section or reduce gobo scale when paired with fast sweeps. If gobo must be present on sweep, use large-scale breakup or very soft edge gobos to maintain beam legibility.",
    "Color hold guidance: Ensure 'transition_1_palette_cleanse' (bars 33-40) remains in WHITE and flows into 'build_1' WHITE to avoid an unnecessary color flicker; reserve RED for 'drop_hit_1' and 'chorus_1' to keep the RED scene impactful.",
