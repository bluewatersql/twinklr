Movement hierarchy follows the design philosophy: low-energy sections use single ambient templates; medium sections use 2-layer complementary combinations where one layer is structural (sweep/pose) and the other is rhythmic (dimmer chase/pulse) to avoid redundancy. Peak moments are intentionally isolated as single-template signatures with strobe reserved for only the true drops/chorus climax, keeping total strobe well under the 30% fatigue threshold. Gobos are treated as rare texture accents (clouds in build, dots in breakdown) and otherwise kept open to preserve beam readability, especially during fast/high-energy movement. Transitions prioritize clean pose changes (fade-through-black) and avoid abrupt vertical jumps by ending sections in poses that naturally set up the next (SOFT_HOME ↔ FORWARD ↔ AUDIENCE_CENTER).",
  "implementation_approach": "Implemented each plan section as bar-aligned blocks matching the plan exactly. Single-template sections target ALL fixtures with layer_priority 0 for maximum clarity (intro, transition, drop hit, final peak). Two-template sections use only disjoint target pairs to avoid conflicts: LEFT+RIGHT for spatial dialogue where a main bed plus accent reads clearly, and ODD+EVEN for alternating/texture sections to enhance rhythmic separation. Intensity is mapped strictly from plan energy to SMOOTH/DRAMATIC/INTENSE. Base poses follow the plan’s flow goals (SOFT_HOME → FORWARD → AUDIENCE_CENTER) to minimize pose jumps at transitions; priority 0 is always the structural/main layer, priority 1 the rhythmic/texture accent."
